Eucalyptus trees come from forests as opposed to cotton that comes from farms. Farms require certain levels of pesticides as opposed to a natural forest which requires nothing but sunlight and rain to survive. Eucalyptus trees are known for their quick growth and properly trained foresters who cut Eucalyptus trees above the root bulb so the trees grow back to size within just 5 - 8 years. </p> <p> Once a tree has been initially harvested, new trees regenerate. One hundred percent non-toxic solvents are used when converting Eucalyptus pulp to fiber, and 99.6% of this solvent is recovered and re-used, over and over again, creating a truly sustainable model of production. </p> <p> The ability to produce eucalyptus fiber while having almost complete recovery of the solvent is an astounding reality and is unique to Tencel+Plus&trade; Lyocell brand eucalyptus.</p><p>The choice to blend cotton, which is the most desirable fiber for luxury bedding applications, with eucalyptus fiber is an innovative choice that has had astounding results. We researched the manufacturing processes of numerous natural fibers before committing product development funds towards fiber from eucalyptus for the LIVING FRESH&reg; bedding line. As a result, Valley Forge chose to partner with Lenzing AG from Austria and developed our exclusive eucalyptus fiber, Tencel+Plus&trade; Lyocell, which is the only fiber from eucalyptus engineered for hospitality.</p></div></div>"

This moisture reduction reduces bacteria without any additional chemicals or additives, as bacteria is normally created by moisture trapped in polyester or cotton fabrics during sleep. In turn, this also lends itself to fewer allergens. Another wonderful aspect of LIVING FRESH&reg; is the soft hand. Unlike other natural fibers, LIVING FRESH&reg; with Tencel+Plus&trade; Lyocell does not require the use of fabric softeners to maintain a soft hand. All of these qualities combine to provide not just a step towards sustainability for the environment, but sustainability for human health and well-being as well.</p></div><div class='col-sm-4'><img class='image' src='http://c67bfc7c934596c5d2de-384a0fe271c727cec0e8a9b32788243a.r54.cf1.rackcdn.com/VFF-20160927-Bedding-2_image.jpg' alt='tencel plus eucalyptus pillow' /></div></div>"
