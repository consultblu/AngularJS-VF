# AngularJS CMS System Preview App
The purpose of this app is to demonstrate the UI components which will be used
to render content from the VFF CMS api. Below you will find documentation about
the different types of content blocks which can be utilized by the CMS api to
display content on the AngularJS site.

## Content Blocks
Content blocks represent a chunk of content on a CMS page. Content
blocks all share a common object structure. Each content block type will
extend the structure further to include properties specific to that content
block type.

```
{
  "content_block_type": <content_block_type_here>,
  "alignment": <alignment_here>,
  "color": <color_here>
}
```

### Properties
* `content_block_type`
  * type: `string`
  * description: This defines the type of the content block and is what the AngularJS frontend will use to determine how to render the object.
  * possible values: `banner`, `banner_carousel`, `standard_block`, `two_column`, `call_to_action`, `horizontal_rule`, `three_column`
* `alignment`
  * type: `string`
  * description: Determines alignment of content in the block.
  * default value: `left`
  * possible values: `left`, `center`, `right`
* `color`
  * type: `string`
  * description: Determines text color of the content block.
  * default value: `black`
  * possible values: `black`, `gray`

## Buttons
Some content block objects allow a `button` property.

```
{
  "label": <button_label_here>,
  "url": <button_url_here>,
  "style": <button_style_here>
}
```

### Properties
* `label`
  * type: `string`
  * description: The button label.
* `url`
  * type: `string`
  * description: The url to link to. For relative urls within this AngularJS App, the url
  should always begin with a `/` and NEVER end with a `/`.
* `style`
  * type: `string`
  * description: This property determines the visual style of the button.
  * possible values:
      * `normal`: medium-gray fill, and light-gray text
      * `transparent-white`: white border and text, transparent center
      * `transparent-black`: black border and text, transparent center
      * `transparent-dark-gray`: dark-gray border and text, transparent center
      * `transparent-blue`: blue border and text, transparent center
      * `dark-gray`: dark gray fill with medium-gray color text
      * `blue`: blue fill, white text
      * `red`: red fill, white text

**Example**
```
{
  "label": "Go to Search!",
  "url": "/search",
  "style": "blue"
}
```

## Links
Some content blocks allow a `link` property. The `url` property should follow
the same rules as the `url` property of the button, mentioned above.

```
{
  "url": <link_url_here>,
  "label": <link_label_here>
}
```

**Example**
```
{
  "url": "/guidelines",
  "label": "View Guidlines"
}
```

# Content Block Types
Content block types are described below.

## `banner`
### Description
This content block type will be used for images that span the entire
page width, but are not inside of a carousel. They can optionally be linked to
another page in this AngularJS site, if a `url` is provided.

```
{
  "content_block_type": "banner",
  "banner": {
    "url": <banner_url_here>,
    "images": {
      "xs": <url_to_320_image_here>,
      "sm": <url_to_480_image_here>,
      "md": <url_to_768_image_here>,
      "lg": <url_to_992_image_here>,
      "xl": <url_to_1400_image_here>
    }
  }
}
```

### Properties
* `banner.url`
  * type: `string`
  * description: If a url is provided, the banner will be clickable and will be
  linked to the provided url. If no url is provided, the banner will NOT be
  clickable. Same rules as the button urls apply here. Relative paths should
  always begin with a `/` and NEVER end with a `/`.
* `banner.images`
  * type: `object`
  * description: The images object needs to contain 5 properties, named `xs`,
  `sm`, `md`, `lg`, and `xl`. These 5 images are the 5 images that are
  generated by the PSD Template that SB has provided.

## `banner_carousel`
### Description
This content block type will be used to display responsive carousel/sliders.

```
{
  "content_block_type": "banner_carousel",
  "banner_carousel": [
    {
      "url": <banner_url_here>,
      "images": {
        "xs": <url_to_320_image_here>,
        "sm": <url_to_480_image_here>,
        "md": <url_to_768_image_here>,
        "lg": <url_to_992_image_here>,
        "xl": <url_to_1400_image_here>
      }
    },

      "images": {
        "xs": <url_to_320_image_here>,
        "sm": <url_to_480_image_here>,
        "md": <url_to_768_image_here>,
        "lg": <url_to_992_image_here>,
        "xl": <url_to_1400_image_here>
      }
    },
    {
      "url": <banner_url_here>,
      "images": {
        "xs": <url_to_320_image_here>,
        "sm": <url_to_480_image_here>,
        "md": <url_to_768_image_here>,
        "lg": <url_to_992_image_here>,
        "xl": <url_to_1400_image_here>
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Properties
* `banner_carousel`
  * type: `array`
  * description: The `banner_carousel` array is an array of `banner` objects,
  as described by the `banner` above. The structure of each item in the array
  should match the `banner` object structure. Banner images will be shown in
  the order they appear in the array.

## `standard_block`
### Description
This content block type will contain the following 3 elements, in this order:
* header
* paragraph
* button
* link

All elements in `standard_block` are optional, as you may need to only display
a header in one block, and only a paragraph in another block. In some cases you
may want to use a button, and in other cases you may want to use a link.

```
{
  "content_block_type": "standard_block",
  "color": <content_block_color_here>,
  "alignment": <content_block_alignment_here>,
  "standard_block": {
    "headline": <headline_here>,
    "body": <block_body_here>,
    "button": <button_element_here>,
    "link": <link_element_here>
  }
}
```

* `standard_block.headline`
  * type: `string`
  * description: A headline for the block. If omitted, no headline displayed.
* `standard_block.body`
  * type: `string`
  * description: The body for this content block. If omitted, no body displayed.
* `standard_block.button`
  * type: `object`
  * description: See notes above about the expected `button` object structure.
  If omitted, no button displayed.
* `standard_block.link`
  * type: `string`
  * description: A link to be displayed at the end of this content block. If
  omitted, no link displayed. See notes above about the expected `link` object
  structure.

**Example**
```
{
  "content_block_type": "standard_block",
  "color": "black",
  "alignment": "left",
  "standard_block": {
    "headline": "Selling Guidelines",
    "body": "Join our creative community of designers, artists and buyers to explore the infinite possibilities of design. Inspire, Create and Design on Weaver, a creative community like no other!",
    "link": {
      "url": "/guidelines",
      "label": "View Guidlines"
    }
  }
}
```

## `two_column`
### Description
Use this content block type to display items in a two-column arrangement. Items
will be displayed in order that they are defined in the `two_column` array.
Item display will alternate left to right, so the item in `two_column[0]`
will be shown on the left-hand side, the item in `two_column[1]` will be
shown on the right-hand side, the item in `two_column[2]` will be shown on
the right-hand side, and so on.

Items will be stacked vertically at smaller screen sizes, and display order
will remain the same order as the items appear in the `two_column` array.

In the same manner as the `standard_block`, any elements that are omitted or
are empty will not be displayed. Also, headline, body, button and link will be
displayed in the same order as mentioned in the `standard_block` element.

```
{
  "content_block_type": "two_column",
  "color": "gray",
  "two_column": [
    {
      "headline": <headline_here>,
      "body": <body_here>,
      "button": <button_here>,
      "link": <link_here>
    }
  ]
}
```

The same rules for the `headline`, `body`, `button`, and `link` elements apply
as for the `standard_block` element.

**Example**
```
{
  "content_block_type": "two_column",
  "alignment": "left",
  "color": "black",
  "two_column": [
    {
      "headline": "How can I check my commission balance?",
      "body": "Commissions are earned 35 days after sales to allow for returns or other order issues. Visit account section of this App and you will see a Commissions Pending total for sales made within the last 35 days and a Commissions Earned total for commissions more than 35 days old.",
      "button": {
        "label": "Check Balance",
        "url": "/check-commission-balance"
      }
    },
    {
      "headline": "How can I do this?",
      "body": "You can do this.",
      "link": {
        "label": "See How",
        "url": "/see-how-to-do-this"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## `three_column`
### Description
Use this content block type to display items in a three-column arrangement. In
the same manner as the `two_column` type above, items will be displayed in
the order in which they appear in the array.

Items will be stacked vertically at smaller screen sizes, and display order
will remain the same order as the items appear in the `three_column` array.

Each item in the `three_column` array has the same properties as the `two_column`
array above. However, there is one addition. There is an additional field
that can be placed on each item in the `three_column` array called
`super_headline`. This headline will appear above the normal headline in very
large font. It can be used to replicate the "1, 2, 3" numbers on the "Sell" page.

```
{
  "content_block_type": "three_column",
  "three_column": [
    {
      "headline": <headline_here>,
      "body": <body_here>,
      "button": <button_here>,
      "link": <link_here>
    }
  ]
}
```

**Example**
```
{
  "content_block_type": "three_column",
  "color": "black",
  "three_column": [
    {
      "super_headline": "1",
      "headline": "How can I check my commission balance?",
      "body": "Commissions are earned 35 days after sales to allow for returns or other order issues. Visit account section of this App and you will see a Commissions Pending total for sales made within the last 35 days and a Commissions Earned total for commissions more than 35 days old.",
      "button": {
        "label": "Check Balance",
        "url": "/check-commission-balance"
      }
    },
    {
      "super_headline": "2",
      "headline": "How can I check my email?",
      "body": "Check your email.",
      "button": {
        "label": "Check Email",
        "url": "/check-email-balance"
      }
    },
    {
      "super_headline": "3",
      "headline": "How can I do this?",
      "body": "You can do this.",
      "link": {
        "label": "See How",
        "url": "/see-how-to-do-this"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```


## `horizonal_rule`
### Description
Use this content block to display a medium-gray horizontal rule element. No more
is needed for this block than the JSON structure below.

```
{
  "content_block_type": "horizontal_rule"
}
```

## `call_to_action`
### Description
Use the `call_to_action` to display a set of `3` square images that link to
places in this App. These images will be arranged horizontally on larger screen
sizes, in 3 equal-width columns. On smaller screen sizes, the images will stack
vertically. Ideally, these images should be `640px by 640px` in dimension
in order to support higher pixel density displays, such as retina iPhones and
MacBooks.

```
{
  "content_block_type": "call_to_action",
  "call_to_action": [
    {
      "url": <page_to_link_this_cta_to>,
      "image_url": <url_to_cta_image_here>
    }
  ]
}
```

### Properties
* `url`
  * type: `string`
  * description: A url in this App to link this CTA item to.
* `image_url`
  * type: `string`
  * description: The url to the image which will be used for this CTA item.

**Example**
```
{
  "content_block_type": "call_to_action",
  "call_to_action": [
    {
      "url": "/boards/25",
      "image_url": "url_to_image.png"
    },
    {
      "url": "/search",
      "image_url": "another_url_to_image.png"
    },
    {
      "url": "/how-it-works",
      "image_url": "different_url_to_image.png"
    }
  ]
}
```
